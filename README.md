- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @OARAISTUDIOS
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in primarily gamedevelopment but developing a site is also something I wish to do.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: C#, HTML, CSS
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Reaching me, the head developer is simple by contacting timmoo253@gmail.com Simple as that, honestly there is nothing to it. So feel free to speak with me.
Any and most games we upload will be open source and found here, this can allow you to create custom mods of these games to add onto their content.
